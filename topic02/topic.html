        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"> Many people with Autism Spectrum Disorder
            (ASD) have trouble with their ability to coordinate their movements and process their senses. They may also
            display repetitive or stereotyped motions. However, regular physical activity and exercise can have many
            advantages for people with ASD, such as better physical health, and decreased anxiety. I have proposed an
            app idea that will act as their companion and make their exercise more enjoyable. The app titled “Autistic
            Kids Companion” uses a Mediapipe-based pose landmark algorithm to extract landmarks which are given to a
            Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the score of the performed exercise and analyze their body movement.
            The app will also provide which body part they should focus more on to accurately do the exercise. I have
            also provided an idea to use animated characters in place of their body so that it is more entertaining for
            them. Also, I have added a page that will contain many training exercises to guide their parents. The app
            will also collect statistical data about their child's exercise progress and will show a progress chart.
            Further, I have implemented the idea of uploading their performed exercise to an online server, that will
            automatically train a model on the new dataset and distribute the new model to the mobile app. In short, the
            application will enable families with ASD children to live a better and healthier life.</p>
