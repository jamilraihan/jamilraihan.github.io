        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"> Here, we have described the
            details of the project. We have divided the whole project
            into three main parts, those are hardware, circuit diagram and software parts. In the hardware parts
            we have setup the motor with the human body. To do that we have designed a motor shaft to attach
            a lather from the wrist to that motor shaft. Next to keep the motor attach into a block box we have
            designed a motor mount that attaches the motor to the box. Also, to keep the box attach to the
            human shoulder we designed an outfit using lather that attaches the box to the shoulder as shown
            in the Figure. We have used a rubber finger gripper to keep the heart rate sensor attach to the
            fingertip. In the circuit part, we have designed a circuit diagram to read the value from the heart
            rate sensor and to control the motor. An Arduino has been used as the microcontroller to connect
            all the electrical component. The motor driver has been used to control the motor direction and
            speed. A Bluetooth device has been connected to the microcontroller to read and send data from
            and to the computer. In the software part, we send the heart rate sensor data to the computer via
            Bluetooth and receive the motor control input from the computer. To make the hand exercise
            automatic we had to detect weather the hand is in down position or in up position. To achieve that
            we have implemented a pose detection algorithm using the MediaPipe library from google. The
            pose detection algorithm gives us the human body joint land mark data using which we have
            extracted the shoulder, elbow and wrist land mark value. Further we have used these values to
            calculate angle between the biceps and forearm and using the angle we determine whether the hand
            is in down position or up position. If the hand is in down position a command is send to the
            microcontroller to use the motor so that the motor pick ups the hand. As the hand is in up position
            another command is seed to the microcontroller to cut the power to the motor. At this point the
            patient can apply force to bring the hand down to lower position. This process continues and the
            patient gets an automatic hand exercise. Further we have built interface to count the number hand
            exercise and show them in real-time in a window along with the patientâ€™s heart rate data. This
            shows the health condition of the patient as he continuous to do the exercise.</p>
