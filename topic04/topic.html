        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"> This project presents a computer
            vision-controlled robot arm system. It consists of a computer that continuously captures real-time camera
            input and employs a MediaPipe Machine Learning model to recognize hand gestures. The recognized gestures are
            then transmitted to an ESP-32 microcontroller via the WebSocket communication protocol. The robot arm is
            equipped with three stepper motors, responsible for controlling the base, Arm 1, and Arm 2. A 12V, 5A power
            supply is used to provide the necessary power to the stepper motors, while a buck converter steps down the
            voltage to 3.3V for the ESP-32. <br>

            Hand gestures play a crucial role in controlling the robot arm. A rectangular box, adaptable to any location
            within the camera's view, activates the control mechanism when a single hand is displayed. Specific gestures
            control individual robot arm components, with fist or open palm gestures used for vertical arm control and
            left/right placement determining base rotation. The system supports simultaneous control of multiple
            components, enhancing its efficiency and versatility. <br>

            The robot arm's physical design is crafted using PVC board, nuts, bolts, and glue, with the base featuring a
            360-degree rotation capability. The stepper motors and robot arm are connected via couplers. Both the
            microcontroller (ESP-32) and the computer require custom coding: C++ is used for the ESP-32, utilizing the
            Accelstepper library for motor control, and network libraries to enable WebSocket communication. An HTML
            webpage is created to facilitate remote robot arm control. <br>

            The computer vision aspect of the project employs Python to process camera input. A Mediapipe human pose
            prediction model identifies the hand's joint coordinates relative to the screen. A rectangular box
            activation control ensures that gestures are recognized only when the hand is outside the box. A four-finger
            gesture is used to disable the control. This user-friendly gesture control mechanism makes the robot arm
            versatile and accessible for various applications.</p>
